# Node.js Monitoring and Logging Stack

This project is a full stack application setup using Docker Compose. It includes the following services:
- **Node.js** application
- **Redis** for caching
- **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** for logging
- **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for monitoring

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

- [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Services

1. **Node.js App**: A sample Node.js application running on port `8080`.
2. **Redis**: A key-value data store running on port `6379` (containerized version).
3. **Elasticsearch**: A search engine for storing logs, running on port `9200`.
4. **Kibana**: A dashboard to visualize logs and data from Elasticsearch, running on port `5601`.
5. **Prometheus**: A monitoring system for scraping application metrics, running on port `9090`.
6. **Grafana**: A powerful dashboard for visualizing metrics, running on port `3001`.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### Step 2: Build and Start the Docker Containers

Use Docker Compose to build and start all the services:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This will:
- Build the Node.js application using the provided `Dockerfile`.
- Start all the services: Node.js, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana.

### Step 3: Accessing Services

Once the containers are up and running, you can access the various services as follows:

#### 1. **Node.js App**
- **URL**: http://localhost:8080
- **Description**: The Node.js application serves your main business logic and exposes metrics for Prometheus to scrape.

#### 2. **Redis**
- **URL**: No direct URL; Redis is available inside the Docker network on port `6379`.
- **Description**: Redis is used for caching data in the Node.js app.

#### 3. **Elasticsearch**
- **URL**: http://localhost:9200
- **Description**: Elasticsearch is used to store and search logs collected from the Node.js application.

#### 4. **Kibana**
- **URL**: http://localhost:5601
- **Description**: Kibana is used to visualize the logs stored in Elasticsearch. You can create visualizations and dashboards by connecting Kibana to your Elasticsearch instance.

#### 5. **Prometheus**
- **URL**: http://localhost:9090
- **Description**: Prometheus scrapes metrics from the Node.js app and provides monitoring capabilities.

#### 6. **Grafana**
- **URL**: http://localhost:3001
- **Default Login**: 
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `admin` (you will be prompted to change this on first login)
- **Description**: Grafana provides a dashboard interface to visualize metrics collected by Prometheus. You can create custom dashboards to monitor the application.

### Step 4: Configure Grafana Dashboard

After logging into Grafana, follow these steps to configure it:

1. Go to **Configuration > Data Sources**.
2. Add **Prometheus** as a data source:
   - URL: `http://prometheus:9090`
3. Import a dashboard template for visualizing Node.js metrics. You can search for existing templates on the Grafana dashboard marketplace.

### Step 5: Monitoring Logs in Kibana

1. Once Kibana is running, open it in your browser.
2. Navigate to **Management > Index Patterns** and create a new index pattern to visualize logs from Elasticsearch. Use the default index `logstash-*`.
3. You can now use **Discover** to view logs or create visualizations and dashboards for further analysis.

## Stopping the Services

To stop and remove all running services, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure all ports are free on your machine before running the services.
- If any service fails to start, check the Docker Compose logs for error messages:
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs
  ```

## Customization

- You can modify the Prometheus scraping intervals in the `prometheus.yml` file.
- Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus, and Grafana configurations can also be customized depending on your specific needs.
